The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Data Pipeline implemented in this project is designed to automate the data preprocessing workflow using Pandas and Scikit-Learn in a Jupyter Notebook. The pipeline focuses on efficiently handling raw data, transforming it for machine learning, and saving the processed dataset for further analysis. By automating these steps, the pipeline ensures data consistency and quality, which are critical for accurate machine learning models.

Extracting Data
The ETL process begins with data extraction, where the raw dataset is loaded from a CSV file using Pandas. This step ensures that the dataset is accessible and ready for processing. Extracting data from structured files like CSV is essential for data-driven applications, as it provides a structured foundation for further transformations. The extracted data is then examined for missing values, inconsistencies, and irregularities that need to be addressed in the preprocessing stage.

Data Preprocessing
Once extracted, the next step is data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Missing values in numerical columns are replaced using the mean imputation strategy, ensuring that missing data does not disrupt model performance. For categorical variables, missing values are filled with the most frequently occurring category to maintain consistency. This step is crucial as missing values can negatively impact machine learning models if not handled properly.

Feature Transformation
After handling missing data, numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler, ensuring that all numeric values have a consistent scale. Standardization is particularly important when working with algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes, such as logistic regression and neural networks. Meanwhile, categorical features undergo One-Hot Encoding, which converts categorical values into numerical representations that machine learning models can understand. This transformation ensures that categorical variables do not introduce biases due to their original textual representations.

Applying Data Pipelines
The pipeline leverages Scikit-Learn's ColumnTransformer to efficiently apply different transformations to numerical and categorical columns within the same workflow. This approach allows for modular and scalable preprocessing, making it easy to adjust transformations based on dataset requirements. Using a pipeline ensures that all preprocessing steps are performed consistently, reducing the chances of errors or inconsistencies in data handling.

Splitting and Saving Data
Following data transformation, the dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split(). This ensures that the model is trained on one portion of the data while the other portion is reserved for evaluation. A well-balanced train-test split is essential for avoiding overfitting and ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. The training and testing datasets are then saved as separate CSV files (train_data.csv and test_data.csv) to facilitate easy access for machine learning tasks.

Project Structure and Execution
The Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive way to run the ETL steps, making it easy to modify and visualize the transformation process. Users can load their dataset into the notebook, execute each cell step by step, and observe the impact of preprocessing transformations in real time. The project is structured to be flexible, allowing users to apply it to different datasets with minimal modifications.

Applications and Benefits
This ETL pipeline is particularly useful for machine learning and data science projects, where data preprocessing plays a crucial role in model performance. The ability to automate data cleaning and transformation helps reduce manual effort, allowing data scientists to focus on model building and analysis rather than data wrangling. By ensuring clean and well-prepared data, the pipeline significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of downstream machine learning tasks.

Installation and Dependencies
Users can clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the notebook to see the pipeline in action. The required dependencies include Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and NumPy, which can be installed using:
bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
